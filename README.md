# Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Based 3D Mesh Model Privacy Preservation Scheme via Geometric Projection
Abstract—Reversible data hiding (RDH) provides a practical solution for the secure storage and transmission of sensitive data in cloud environments. With the increasing adoption of three-dimensional (3D) mesh models in fields that require high privacy and intellectual property protection, RDH techniques specifically designed for these models have gained considerable attention. However, existing RDH schemes for 3D mesh models often encounter limitations such as a low embedding capacity, low runtime efficiency, or insufficient security. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel privacy preservation scheme that integrates the geometric projection strategy with Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption (ECIE). The geometric projection strategy effectively exploits local geometric regularities within mesh models, thereby enhancing the vertex prediction accuracy. The integration of ECIE into the RDH framework further strengthens security by mitigating the risks associated with symmetric key transmission, providing enhanced protection tailored to customized data. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed scheme achieves superior embedding capacity and vertex utilization rate while maintaining perfect reversibility, separable data extraction, and high runtime efficiency.
